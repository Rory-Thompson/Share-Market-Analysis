1) creating testing suite

2) update function to be deployable on any machine (no longer use disk station and instead use the yfinance endpoint)

3) make a quicker version that can be used (download a cached version of day df instead of generating the whole thing.

4) make plotting easier to access without having to generate complex df ( maybe if no instantiation of data )

5) create a dashboard for the stocks that are generated using the plotting module.
